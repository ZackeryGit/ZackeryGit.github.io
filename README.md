My coding portfolio, I love scripting and working on systems, take a look around and thank you for the opportunity!

Tour around my portfolio:

I've split into 2 folders, one of past games I've made in unity, The other has art from class

Games Overview:

1. Matching game:

Simple game to learn the basics of Unity

2. Platformer:

My first choice at a game. This game has very little gameplay, but has tons of systems implements into it. Includes power ups that give the player an extra 1-2 mid-air jumps or speed, currency collectibles, dying, cayote timer, partical emitions, etc

3. 3D Cookie Clicker:

Given the prompt of a mobile game, I decided to make a Cookie clicker, as I want to focus on how communication works across unity scripts. I wanted to also make a cookie clicker that instead of 100 upgrades of more passive income, each upgrade has a unique addition to the gameplay. Like an upgrade that spawns chests, one that makes chests spawn more frequently, and ones that boosts chest values are of some examples.

I even included a stat / upgrade system into this game, that allows me to easily make an upgradeable stat like "Chest Spawn Speed" which can be increased either additively or multiplicatively.

There is a store button store, where all you have to do is duplicate a button, fill in some things in the public parameters, and the button auto generates with the title, description, current price, current level, etc. The store also includes upgrades that require other upgrade to be bought first in order to be purchased.

4. Work in Progress Room Gen

This is a very much work in progress game, as I just started to work on it, but still when ran places 2 rooms connected to each other (currently both the same due to where I am with building the structure). This room generator is able to generate a random room from a list, and what I'm trying to make right now which causes the same "Start Room" to spawn twice, is a biome system, where every like 25 - 50 rooms (Dependant on the biome) will change to a different room theme/biome. Just right now I have it set to the "Start Room" biome which will eventually be the first room, and then the 2nd room will swap to a different "Starting zone" or "Random" biome. This project is for the Game Design 3 Class.
